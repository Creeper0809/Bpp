# B Language v6 Development Plan

## Maintenance

- [x] v6 created from v5 baseline (2026-02-06)
- [x] v6 re-created from v5 and rebuilt cleanly (2026-02-06)
- [x] v6 remove emitter_force_vec_instantiations and pass build (blocked: missing Vec<*ConstInfo/StringEntry> symbols; resolved-name aliasing added)
- [x] v6 remove compiler_force_hashmap_instantiations and pass build (pending previous step)
